# Expression-Evaluator-Console
**Goal:** Designing class that can accept a valid string representing a mathemathical equation (infix). After receiving string, should be able to compute equation and return prefix, infix, and postifx notations of equation.
- Wanted to also practice implementing custom LinkedList, Stack, and Queue class without using any built-in libraries (e.g. ArrayLists)
- Also implemented custom token class to tokenize expression and individualize operators, operands, parentheses, etc.

**Why this matters?**
- Prefix and postfix notations are useful for evaluating mathematical expressions in computer programs since it elimiates the need for parentheses.

**To Fix/Include:**
- Want to add mini user interface using Java GUIs
- Clean up any redudant code and potentially implement my own string functions
- Want to add the functionality to give prefix and postfix notation equation and convert it to the other types of notations.
